# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹  

Iâ€™m Ayokunle, a full-stack developer based in Nigeria.  

I love building **useful, delightful, and high-performing web experiences** that solve real problems. My interests span across **AI/ML, blockchain, and scalable software engineering**.  

Outside of coding, youâ€™ll find me exploring new tech trends, gaming ðŸŽ® (RPGs & FPS on a potato PC ðŸ˜Ž), or brainstorming creative project ideas. I also enjoy learning and sharing knowledge through open-source projects.
